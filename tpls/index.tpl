<h1>Dashboard</h1>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>You should create web application. This application should be simple task manager. Consisting
    of:</p>
<ul class="ul-normal">
    <li>Create Task</li>
    <li>Edit Task</li>
    <li>Report Time</li>
    <li>Close Task</li>
    <li>List Tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>Your solution have to be JS based client. That communicates with PHP based backend. Over
    JSON based API (REST or REST like). This backend should write and read data from/to at least
    two persistent data storing layers based on configuration. Those layers have to have same
    access interface. One of those persistent layers have to be SQL database. Second persistent
    layer you are free to chose (not SQL database). Using OOP on LAMP architecture. No need for
    data validation only sanitize to avoid security risks.</p>
<h3>Result</h3>
<p>You shouldnâ€™t spent more than 8 hours on this test. Send us code in git repository. Including
    Readme file with deploy instructions and any data files necessary for deployment.</p>

<h3>Optional (plus)</h3>
<p>These are nice to have and will yield bonus points but its perfectly ok not to meet them:</p>
<ul class="ul-normal">
    <li>With repository send us link where the task manager is deployed.</li>
    <li>Use Hack lang (in strict mode as much as possible) instead of PHP</li>
    <li>Use Coffeescript instead of JS (but compiled into native JS)</li>
    <li>Create code documentation</li>
    <li>API Unit Tests</li>
</ul>
