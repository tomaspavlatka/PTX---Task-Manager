# PTX Task Manager

## Problem to be solved

You should create web application. This application should be simple task manager. Consisting of:

* Create Task
* Edit Task
* Report Time
* Close Task
* List Tasks

Your solution have to be JS based client. That communicates with PHP based backend. Over JSON based API (REST or 
REST like). This backend should write and read data from/to at least two persistent data storing layers based on configuration. Those layers have to have same access interface. One of those persistent layers have to be SQL database. Second persistent layer you are free to chose (not SQL database). Using OOP on LAMP architecture. No need for data validation only sanitize to avoid security risks.

### Result

You should not spent more than 8 hours on this test. Send us code in git repository. Including Readme file with deploy instructions and any data files necessary for deployment.

### Optional (plus)

These are nice to have and will yield bonus points but its perfectly ok not to meet them:

* With repository send us link where the task manager is deployed.
* Use Hack lang (in strict mode as much as possible) instead of PHP
* Use Coffeescript instead of JS (but compiled into native JS)
* Create code documentation
* API Unit Tests

## Solution

Simple tasks manager using jQuery and PHP to operate. It saves into database and also into a files.
